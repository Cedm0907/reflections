How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Comparing both files content and showing only those lines that unmatch.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    For helo to solve some problems on the go.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    I think is OK the automatic update for files, but not at all for code because sometimes you're trying to implement some new functions and tested it before launch it.
    A con of doing manually is forget to do it.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
 
    It's a useful characteristic because sometimes you update css, js, html, files all at once and those changes all your development.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Completing it using the commit ID and the output is the same as comparing to files directly.
 
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
